<center><h1>As im sure you have heard, the PC Master Race is the best and here are some of the reasons why. </h1></center>
<ul>
  <li>We have mods for pretty much any game you can play on a console</li>
  <li>We get 60FPS while consoles are limited to 30-45FPS</li>
  <li>You dont need to pay every month just to play games online with people</li>
  <li>You can aim way better with a mouse than with a controller</li>
  <li>in the long run a PC will cost less since you wont have to get a new one every 4 years</li>
  <li>There are sales that are more often and way better than on console so you save money on games</li> 
  <li>You wont have to worry about little kids being annoying on the mic</li> 
  <li>A PC can do way more than play games and videos</li>
  <li>If i was using a console and not a PC this site wouldnt be here</li>
  <li>PCs can run games so muhc better, a gamethat runs 30FPS on console could run 120FPS+ on a PC</li>
</ul>
